# REPLICATION: MEIOSIS
The Replication oficial Read-execute-print-loop commmand line interface

# Contents

As the OAIF's REPL/CLI Meiosis currently contains the following

- main.py - the main file that contains the logic for reading and parsing the manifests
- settings.nln - the testing settings file, make sure to update it with prod settings
- manifest.nln - a basic cromossome manifest file for meiosis, its a good starting point if you want to make your own meiosis app
- MANUAL.MD - TBA a markdown explaining the operation and development for Meiosis
- imports - A Folder with testing/default issue imports, currently it only contains the `internals` package
# ATTENTION

My good brother in Rah, make sure to copy the `cromossome` folder to inside the `meiosis` folder when you want to run this, when automatic building is made it wont be nescessary but you will need to build the aplication before testing

# Roadmap

- [x] Make v1
- [x] Make the 'meiosis_internals' command package with stuff that will make the experience of using this not so miserable
- [ ] Add the `MANUAL.MD`
- [ ] Add some sort of piping debauchery
